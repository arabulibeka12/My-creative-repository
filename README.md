# My-creative-repository
This repository is created to collect and share **creative, educational, and practical resources**.   It is not focused on code — instead, it contains **notes, translations, datasets, writing samples, and cheatsheets**.   The goal is to build a space where ideas, knowledge, and inspiration can be organized and easily accessed.
